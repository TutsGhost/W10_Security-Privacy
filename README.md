# Windows 10 Security & Privacy Guide

This guide is just a collection and explanation on how i harden the security and privacy of my Windows10 machine. I'am in no way an IT Expert and this is just a personal guide.
If you guys encounter anything please let me know. This project is also very open to suggestions.

The endgoal of this guide is to have a better ease of mind while using Windows10, this includes still being able to play games (online & offline) and work with office files.
I would still not advise doing any of the steps from this guide on your workplace, unless you really know what you are doing (i would still advise against it).
